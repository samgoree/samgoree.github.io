My name is Sam Goree, I am a PhD candidate in Informatics at Indiana University and an interdisciplinary scholar interested in computer vision, human-computer interaction and the digital humanities.

Specifically, I'm interested in ways of developing AI tools which are grounded in the philosophy and methods of the humanities. I think this is becoming increasingly important as both big data studies of culture and generative modeling are expanding our field into areas typically studied by humanists. I'm also interested in using humanistic approaches to think about the culture of computing in order to better understand the limitations of new tech.

During my PhD, Iâ€™ve explored these topics at the intersection of computer vision and the history of web design, and in the context of image aesthetic quality assessment. See [here]({{site.basurl}}/posts.html) for some of my other projects!
