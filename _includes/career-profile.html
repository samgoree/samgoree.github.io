    <p>My name is Sam Goree, I'm a recent graduate of Oberlin College in Ohio, where I majored in computer science and musical studies, and am currently a graduate student at <a href=https://www.sice.indiana.edu//>Indiana University</a>. Welcome to my personal slice of the internet! I've used this blog in the past to detail an honors research project that I completed and some other miscellaneous work, and will continue to use it to document future projects of mine.</p>
