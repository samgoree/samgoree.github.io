title: Final Thesis
excerpt: The next step towards machine composition of four-part harmony, after working with a naive generative model, was to try to implement other models that better preprocessed training data. My ultimate goal with these is to apply Geoffry Hinton's Product of Experts and multiply together the output probability distributions of several models trained on different aspects of the training data to get a more nuanced result.

Final Thesis
===================================================

##### 3/26/17

Despite never getting the chance to post about generation schemes or survey design (which I plan to do retroactively at some point!), I was able to complete my research and sumbit my thesis on time.

Here's a [download link]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Honors_Thesis.pdf) for those interested!
