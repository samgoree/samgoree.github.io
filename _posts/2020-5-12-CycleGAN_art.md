CycleGANs and Mimesis
===================================================

Recently, I've been thinking about AI art and memesis. GANs, like mimetic artists, try to replicate the real world as faithfully as possible, but they can't do it perfectly. Rather than write a lot explaining what I was thinking, I wrote a little bit of text along with images and gifs to explore these ideas visually. Enjoy!
