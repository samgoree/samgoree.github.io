# Hire me!

My name is Sam Goree, I’m a NSF Graduate Research Fellow and PhD candidate in Informatics at Indiana University and I’m on the job market! I’m looking at tenure track/non-tenure track/visiting faculty positions in computer science, information science or a related area in the Northeast US, though I’m open to postdocs as well for the right project.

**Teaching:** I have a passion for teaching computer science, and particularly for showing people with interests in other areas how computing might be of use to them. Last year, after several semesters of working as a teaching assistant, I took a class in postsecondary pedagogy at Indiana University’s education school where I designed my own version of a class in my department, “Python for Data Analysis,” then taught that class to 21 undergraduates the following semester.

I have bachelors degrees in computer science and music, industry experience as a data scientist and a PhD in Informatics investigating applications of computer vision to design history. As such, I am a candidate capable of teaching a wide variety of courses. For example:
* Introductory computer science courses in programming, data structures and algorithms
* Upper-level undergraduate computer science courses in AI, HCI, machine learning, image processing and computer vision
* Flexible-level interdisciplinary courses (including at the graduate level) in digital humanities, data science, computational creativity and internet studies.

If you’re interested in having someone like me in your department, please reach out!

**Research:** Generally, I want to develop AI tools grounded in the philosophy and methods of the humanities. I think this is important to study because big data studies of culture and new text and image generation are expanding computer science into topics which have typically been studied by humanists. Conversely, we can also take a humanistic approach to the culture of computing, and use that to better understand the potential harms of new technologies. During my PhD, I’ve explored these topics at the intersection of computer vision and the history of web design, in the context of image aesthetic quality assessment.

My research interests span include a variety of interdisciplinary applications of AI and human-computer interaction:
* Cultural analytics
* Science and technology studies (particularly the culture of computing)
* Computer vision (both contemporary deep learning and classical)
* Web design history
* Color theory and colorimetry
* Humanistic HCI
* Visualization/visual analytics
* Generative modeling
* Digital humanities
* AI ethics/transparency/bias/fairness
* Music information retrieval

If you’re looking for someone with a subset of these interests, please reach out! My CV is on the sidebar, I’m happy to send along more formal teaching/research/diversity statements on request.
