Final Thesis
===================================================

##### 3/26/17

Despite never getting the chance to post about generation schemes, survey design or results (which I plan to do retroactively at some point!), I was able to get to a stopping point in my research and write up a thesis.

Here's a [download link]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/Honors_Thesis.pdf) for those interested!

This is still a work in progress, as I haven't submitted it for publication anywhere, so comments and questions are very helpful. Contact me at the email address in the sidebar.

If I learned anything from this research, it's that researching alone is hard. There's a lot of issues that get solved before they even become bugs in your code by communicating your work with a colleague that, if left unarticulated, create large problems. If you misinterpret something that isn't significant enough for your advisor to pick up on, it probably doesn't get corrected until it's too late to change course.
