This is my own personal test of markdown and jekyll
===================================================

##### 11/16/16

While I've written some markdown before (mostly for readme files in github because I like pretty headings and stuff) I wanted to practice (and also check out the cool jekyll features). 


For instance in Jekyll, you can do code highlighting:

{% highlight ruby %}
 
 public static void main(String[] args){
 	System.out.println("Java is the most verobse high-level language ever!")
 }

{% endhighlight %}

Which works differently than code in plain markdown:


	public static void main(String[] args){
		System.out.println("Java is the most verobse high-level language ever!")
	}

Markdown supports indented quotes:

Jekyll can also generate post summaries. For instance, for this post, the summary would look like:

<a href="{{ page.url }}">{{ page.title }}</a>

{{ page.excerpt }}

Lastly, I can link to things on different websites pretty easily using markdown's notation. For instance, [This link](http://www.google.com "I even have title-text") goes to google.com
